	* Cache now do an assert on the introduction of the same pointer
	  with addPointer. This is a quick fix (not particularly elegant,
	  i know) for giving back always the same object code when the 
	  same object is referenced. The Cache clients _must_ check 
	  if the pointer is already present before feeding it to the cache
	  and eventually free the allocated resource. A future release will
	  include reference counting, thus freeing the clients from this check
	  and enforcing a transparent usage.
	* Simplified PointerType. There's no need for child of Type_GdomeNode,
	  since we can use the virtualized destructor of Node for each child
